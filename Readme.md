# QGisLayerStyleLoader
The main purpose of the plugin is an easy and quick way of setting multiple layer styles for the layers in the current project. The layer styles therefore are saved in subdirectories in a parent directory and must be named like the layers in your project.

How To:
  - Install the plugin from the plugin-manager (Layer Style Loader) or get it from [github]
  - Open the plugin (it will appear on the left docker)
  - Set the parent folder path of your subdirectories which contain the qml files
  - Select a style folder
